            <p class="p"id="opus">This minecraft is special because it is the same minecraft bedrock edition, but it has the chemistry of the board and a lot of features.
            There are even NPCs! It has a very special robot that understands Python and Scratch. 
            He can build houses, spawn mobs, walk to perform actions thanks to which you can create mini games without command blocks. 
            Friend, do not rush to create a server there, it can be created only through a VPN and you have to pay 5 dollars a month. 
            Do not be disappointed when you created an account, you can play 10 times and create a new and new account. 
            That is, this minecraft is special in its kind, because it is FREE and you can download it both on your phone and on a PC, in the Play Market, or in the Microsoft Store. 
            I know exactly where you can download this minecraft. 
            Below is the link for registration in the Play Market and for the Microsoft Store. 
            This is all about Minecraft education edition. 
            But wait, I said that you can create many accounts, but there is one but, you need to have a bunch of phone numbers. 
            You will say why, because Microsoft noticed this and took away the Sing in button and made restrictions. 
            So I recommend never closing this minecraft. 
            Later I will make such an app for PC, it may not be available on phones, but it is a matter of time. 
            This is exactly everything about Minecraft Education Edition.<img src="https://top-mmo.fr/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/5fe627dd-minecraft.jpg"height="250px"></p>
